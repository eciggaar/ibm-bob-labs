## 📋 The Situation

In our sample scenario, the HR team is your biggest user group. You want to understand the `HRDocument` class deeply — all its properties, what's searchable, what's inherited from the base class, and what's HR-specific.

## 💬 Prompt to Bob

1. Make sure **Agent Mode** is selected and enter the following prompt:

    ```
    Show me everything about the HRDocument class. I want to see all its 
    properties — their data types, whether they're searchable, and which 
    ones are system-owned vs custom business properties.
    ```

## 🔍 What Bob Does Behind the Scenes

- **Activates the `class-property-report` skill**, which loads the analysis rules and the local formatting script into context.
- **Resolves the class name** by calling `determine_class` on the `core-cs-mcp-server` with keyword `"HRDocument"` — confirming the symbolic name before making any further calls.
- **Fetches all 108 properties** — including every inherited system property — by calling `get_class_property_descriptions` for `HRDocument` on the `core-cs-mcp-server`.
- **Analyses and presents a verified report** by piping the raw property list through the skill's deterministic script, which splits properties into custom vs system, counts searchability and visibility, numbers every row, and cross-checks the total — without Bob inventing any counts of its own.

## ✅ Expected Output from Bob

Bob should return a structured property breakdown:

A few things worth noting about the custom business properties on this class:

- **Core HR identity** (#10–14): `FirstName`, `LastName`, `PersonalID`, `Birthdate`, `EmployeeID` — all STRING/DATE, all searchable and visible.
- **Job attributes** (#15–21): `JobRole`, `JobFunction`, `JobCode`, `JobLevel`, `JobStatus`, `EmploymentType`, `CurrentStatus` — all STRING, searchable.
- **Org structure** (#22–30): Company, BusinessUnit, Division, Department, CostCenter, Location, StartDate, TerminationDate.
- **SAP integration** (#31–38): A rich set of SAP-specific fields (`SAPEmployeeID`, `SAPDocId`, `SAPDocProt`, `SAPComps`, etc.) for bidirectional SAP ArchiveLink integration.
- **Salesforce integration** (#39–40): `SFLinkTrigger` and `SfSalesforceRelationships`.
- **Docuflow** (#41–42): `docuflowTimestamp` and `docuflowUsername` for workflow tracking.
- **GenAI** (#8–9): `GenaiDateIndexed` and `GenaiWatsonxSummary` — the class already has watsonx AI summarisation fields baked in.
- **Infra/hidden custom** (#2–7): Entry template tracking and security controller fields, all hidden from end users.

## 💡 Key Insights

#### For Business Analysts
Notice the `DocType` property — this is how we distinguish between a Job Application, a Payslip, a Performance Review, and an Employment Contract. They're all `HRDocument` instances, but `DocType` tells you which kind. This is a key design pattern in IBM Content Cortex: **use properties to differentiate, not separate classes**.

#### For Administrators
The SAP integration properties (`SAPDocId`, `SapLinkTrigger`, `sapLinked`) show that this class is likely connected to an external system. So, before modifying or deprecating this class, you'd need to check with the SAP integration team. Bob can help you identify these dependencies.
